  It is envisioned, for now, that a Scene is used for pixel-based worlds to be
  captured by a camera.

  Or really, I'm torn between using 'Scene' and 'World' for the concept of what
  to call the collection of objects viewed by, and including, the camera.

  So, for now, it's 'Scene', using the play analogy - Scenes upon a Stage.

  Or maybe 'Stage'? Maybe. Thoughts and discussions for another time.

  Update: I put the choice to [redacted]'s '[redacted]' bot (Discord), via
          the ?choosebestof command, parameters:

            times: 100
            choices: scene stage world

          results:

            1. stage (42 times, 42.00%)
            2. scene (37 times, 37.00%)
            3. world (21 times, 21.00%)

  The bot has chosen.

  Or...

  We start with Scenes...

  ... then we support multiple Scenes in a Stage...
  
  ... and the World has many Stages?

  That.. will probably change, but we'll leave it to the future. It's not like
  this project is the first iteration of the camera code... or the last.
